        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with one hour of debate on the motion to instruct conferees on S. Con. Res. 11. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the managers on the part of the House to (1) recede from disagreement with the Senate with respect to sec. 363 of S. Con. Res. 11 (relating to the requirement for earned paid sick time to address the health needs of workers and their families); and (2) to recede from subsection (e)(3) of sec. 808 of the House Amendment (relating to changing the current Medicare program, and replacing it with premium support payments).</text>

        <number>743</number>
        <purpose>To reduce funding for the General Services Administration by $1,000,000 until 50 percent of counties in nonattainment for the 1997 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone as of January 30, 2015, achieve the air quality standard set forth in the 1997 NAAQS, and direct those funds to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the purpose of helping municipalities reach attainment with the 2008 NAAQS for ground-level ozone, acknowledging that (1) given limited State and Federal resources and the delay of the Administrator in issuing to States implementation guidance for the 2008 ground-level ozone NAAQS, priority should be given to achieving the 2008 standard, (2) the Administrator has not sufficiently implemented that standard, (3) focusing by the Administrator on the most polluted areas that are in nonattainment with that standard would benefit public health, and (4) promulgating a lower standard at this time would impose undue costs on the economy and workforce of the United States.</purpose>

(The PAYGO point of order prohibits the consideration of legislation that would cause or increase an on-budget deficit over specified time periods. The short-term deficit point of order applies to legislation that would cause a net increase in the deficit in excess of $10 billion in any fiscal year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution unless it is fully offset over the period of all fiscal years provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.) </p> <p>(Sec. 402) Revises the existing point of order against legislation that would increase long-term deficits. Applies the point of order to legislation that would cause a net increase in on-budget deficits in excess of $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution. (The existing long-term deficit point of order applies to deficits rather than on-budget deficits.)</p> <p>Exempts legislation for which the chairman has made adjustments to the allocations, levels, and limits in this resolution, pursuant to the deficit-neutral reserve fund included in Section (303)(1) for legislation relating to the full repeal of the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>(Sec. 403) Updates the existing point of order against advanced appropriations to conform to the new budget window. (Under the resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2016 that first becomes available after FY2016, or any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2017 that first becomes available after FY2017. The point of order limits advanced appropriations to specified accounts and prohibits total advanced appropriations from exceeding $28.852 billion in new budget authority in each year). </p> <p>(Sec. 404) Increases the vote threshold for waiving points of order against legislation with unfunded intergovernmental mandates from a simple majority to three-fifths of Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes). </p> <p>(Sec. 405) Repeals the point of order against reconciliation legislation that would increase the deficit or reduce a surplus. </p> <p>(Sec. 406) Establishes a point of order restricting the inclusion of changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) in appropriations legislation. Restricts CHIMPs that reduce budget authority but do not decrease outlays by setting a $19 billion limit for these provisions in FY2016. Reduces the limit in each subsequent fiscal year until FY2021, when no CHIMP that fails to reduce outlays will be permitted in appropriations legislation. </p> <p>(Sec. 407) Establishes a point of order against voting on passage of legislation if no Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimate was made publicly available at least 28 hours before the vote. </p> <p>(Sec. 408) Applies to the Senate a House point of order protecting savings in reconciliation legislation from amendments that increase the deficit. </p> <p>(Sec. 409) Establishes a point of order against a provision designating Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds that would cause total OCO funds to exceed $57.997 billion for FY2016 or $59.500 billion for FY2017. </p> <p>(Sec. 410) Establishes a point of order against appropriations legislation that includes changes in mandatory programs that affect the Crime Victims Fund. </p> <p>(Sec. 411) Directs the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, for budget enforcement purposes, to disregard the budgetary effects of timing shifts and rescissions that do not reduce outlays.</p> <p>(Sec. 412) Requires CBO to provide supplemental cost estimates for direct loan and loan guarantee programs by measuring cost on a fair value basis to account for the cost of market risk. </p> <p>(Sec. 413) Directs CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation for informational purposes. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.) </p> <p>(Sec. 414) Provides directions regarding the scoring of legislation relating to a transition from the paper dollar to the dollar coin. </p> <p>(Sec. 415) Provides directions to CBO regarding the scoring of certain energy savings contracts. </p> <p>(Sec. 416) Requires CBO to provide estimates of the budgetary effects over FY2016-FY2045 for legislation increasing discretionary spending limits or transferring amounts from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund. (Most CBO estimates are currently provided over a 5- or 10-year period). </p> <p>(Sec. 417) Requires CBO to provide projections of federal revenues, outlays, and deficits for the 30-year period beginning with the budget year in its required annual update to the Budget and Economic Outlook. </p> <p>(Sec. 418) Requires CBO to provide estimates to Congress on tax expenditures that include: (1) an estimate of the cost of tax expenditures as a share of gross domestic product for the budget year and the 9 years following the budget year, and (2) Data on the cost of tax expenditures as a share of gross domestic product for each fiscal year beginning with FY1965 and ending with the budget year. </p> <p>(Sec. 419) Directs CBO to provide estimates of outlay changes during the second and third decade of enactment of legislation if: (1) either of the budget committee chairs requests the estimate, or (2) the legislation has an outlay impact in excess of 0.25% of the U.S. gross domestic product during the first decade or in the tenth year. </p> <p>(Sec. 420) Requires CBO to provide specified estimates regarding the changes in direct spending and revenues associated with the Affordable Care Act, including the net impact on deficits with both on-budget and off-budget effects. </p> <p>(Sec. 421) Prohibits increases in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) guarantee fees from being used in the Senate to determine budgetary impacts for evaluating budget points of order. (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.) </p> <p>Subtitle B--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 431) Directs Senate committees to review programs and tax expenditures within their jurisdiction to identify waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication and increase the use of performance data to inform committee work. </p> <p>(Sec. 432) Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the budget resolution to include amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service in the allocations to the appropriations committees. </p> <p>(Sec. 433) Sets forth procedures for adjustments of the allocations and aggregates included in the budget resolution. </p> <p>(Sec. 434) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust levels and allocations in this budget resolution to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. </p> <p>(Sec. 435) Declares that the provisions in this title are promulgated under the Senate's rulemaking power and will be considered part of the rules of the Senate. </p>]]></text>

for waivers and appeals of specified budget points of order with a vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes) through September 30, 2025. </p> <p>Makes Senate points of order against legislation violating Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules or increasing the short-term deficit permanent. (The PAYGO point of order prohibits the consideration of legislation that would cause or increase an on-budget deficit over specified time periods. The short-term deficit point of order applies to legislation that would cause a net increase in the deficit in excess of $10 billion in any fiscal year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution unless it is fully offset over the period of all fiscal years provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.) </p> <p>(Sec. 402) Revises the existing point of order against legislation that would increase long-term deficits.

(Under the resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2016 that first becomes available after FY2016, or any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2017 that first becomes available after FY2017. The point of order limits advanced appropriations to specified accounts and prohibits total advanced appropriations from exceeding $28.852 billion in new budget authority in each year). </p> <p>(Sec. 404) Increases the vote threshold for waiving points of order against legislation with unfunded intergovernmental mandates from a simple majority to three-fifths of Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes). </p> <p>(Sec. 405) Repeals the point of order against reconciliation legislation that would increase the deficit or reduce a surplus. </p> <p>(Sec. 406) Establishes a point of order restricting the inclusion of changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) in appropriations legislation. Restricts CHIMPs that reduce budget authority but do not decrease outlays by setting a $19 billion limit for these provisions in FY2016. Reduces the limit in each subsequent fiscal year until FY2021, when no CHIMP that fails to reduce outlays will be permitted in appropriations legislation. </p> <p>(Sec. 407) Establishes a point of order against voting on passage of legislation if no Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimate was made publicly available at least 28 hours before the vote. </p> <p>(Sec. 408) Applies to the Senate a House point of order protecting savings in reconciliation legislation from amendments that increase the deficit. </p> <p>(Sec. 409) Establishes a point of order against a provision designating Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds that would cause total OCO funds to exceed $57.997 billion for FY2016 or $59.500 billion for FY2017. </p> <p>(Sec. 410) Establishes a point of order against appropriations legislation that includes changes in mandatory programs that affect the Crime Victims Fund. </p> <p>(Sec. 411) Directs the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, for budget enforcement purposes, to disregard the budgetary effects of timing shifts and rescissions that do not reduce outlays.</p> <p>(Sec. 412) Requires CBO to provide supplemental cost estimates for direct loan and loan guarantee programs by measuring cost on a fair value basis to account for the cost of market risk. </p> <p>(Sec. 413) Directs CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation for informational purposes. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.) </p> <p>(Sec. 414) Provides directions regarding the scoring of legislation relating to a transition from the paper dollar to the dollar coin. </p> <p>(Sec. 415) Provides directions to CBO regarding the scoring of certain energy savings contracts. </p> <p>(Sec. 416) Requires CBO to provide estimates of the budgetary effects over FY2016-FY2045 for legislation increasing discretionary spending limits or transferring amounts from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund. (Most CBO estimates are currently provided over a 5- or 10-year period). </p> <p>(Sec. 417) Requires CBO to provide projections of federal revenues, outlays, and deficits for the 30-year period beginning with the budget year in its required annual update to the Budget and Economic Outlook. </p> <p>(Sec. 418) Requires CBO to provide estimates to Congress on tax expenditures that include: (1) an estimate of the cost of tax expenditures as a share of gross domestic product for the budget year and the 9 years following the budget year, and (2) Data on the cost of tax expenditures as a share of gross domestic product for each fiscal year beginning with FY1965 and ending with the budget year. </p> <p>(Sec. 419) Directs CBO to provide estimates of outlay changes during the second and third decade of enactment of legislation if: (1) either of the budget committee chairs requests the estimate, or (2) the legislation has an outlay impact in excess of 0.25% of the U.S. gross domestic product during the first decade or in the tenth year. </p> <p>(Sec. 420) Requires CBO to provide specified estimates regarding the changes in direct spending and revenues associated with the Affordable Care Act, including the net impact on deficits with both on-budget and off-budget effects. </p> <p>(Sec. 421) Prohibits increases in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) guarantee fees from being used in the Senate to determine budgetary impacts for evaluating budget points of order. (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.) </p> <p>(Sec. 422) Requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust the allocation to the Senate Appropriations Committee provided pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and all other aggregates, allocations, levels, and limits included in this resolution if legislation is enacted that amends the discretionary spending limits or the sequestration procedures included in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Limits the adjustments in FY2016 and FY2017 to $37 billion for security spending and $37 billion for nonsecurity spending in each fiscal year. </p> <p>(Sec. 423) Requires CBO to include in deficit projections a one-page statement that: (1) summarizes and categorizes total outlays including tax expenditures, receipts, surpluses, and deficits on a unified basis; and (2) includes subtotals for outlays for mandatory and discretionary programs; outlays, tax expenditures, payroll tax revenue, and offsetting receipts for Social Security and for Medicare; the surplus or deficit of revenues over outlays for Social Security and Medicare; and revenues. </p> <p>(Sec. 424) Authorizes the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust aggregates, allocations, levels, and limits included in this resolution if legislation is enacted that permits adjustments to discretionary spending limits to accommodate wildfire suppression funding. </p> <p>Subtitle B--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 431) Directs Senate committees to review programs and tax expenditures within their jurisdiction to identify waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication and increase the use of performance data to inform committee work. </p> <p>(Sec. 432) Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the budget resolution to include amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service in the allocations to the appropriations committees. </p> <p>(Sec. 433) Sets forth procedures for adjustments of the allocations and aggregates included in the budget resolution. </p> <p>(Sec. 434) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust levels and allocations in this budget resolution to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. </p> <p>(Sec. 435) Declares that the provisions in this title are promulgated under the Senate's rulemaking power and will be considered part of the rules of the Senate. </p>]]></text>
